# Moral Letters to Lucilius
This repository contains Persian translation of Moral Letters to Lucilius by Seneca with explanations.
The letters will not be translated in any order or in specific intervals.
The reason I decided to translate these letters(or at least some of them) is to understand and think more deeply in Seneca's words.
Also by a little search I found out there is no other similar open source translations, and so it was a good opportunity.
Maybe it would also help another person.
